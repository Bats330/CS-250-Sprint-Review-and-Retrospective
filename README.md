Sprint Review and Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
When looking at how I interperet user needs and impement them into a program I start by looking at what the user is looking to want added to the program and the importance to the users with adding that to a program that I am working on. User stories allow for a clear and direct chain
Of what that user wants and how we can prioritize each of these into our program with a level of importance it adds a organization to what needs to be implemented into our program.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When looking at how I approach developing programs I start by taking a step back and looking at what my program I am working on is hoping to achive after that I create A sort of gameplan on what the basic requirements are needed.
The agile method can help when it comes to myself and developing programs as it allows for a flexibility in change throughout the process in development and because of that I am able to take things in steps that allow for backtracking if needed
to make small changes and total changes as the development progress can be all over the place with agile as you are not working straight down the list of things that need to be done like Waterfall method instead you can work on different sections as needed
which for me is a nice way to work on a program as it allows for things to flow more smoothly.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
What it means to be a good team member in software development is being able to communicate with the team and allow for a clear understanding of the work I am doing and how I can help other or how other could help me as needed.
